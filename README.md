# Algorithms-Design-and-Analaysis
Python and Java Implementation of Algorithms presented in Stanford's "Algorithms: Design and Analysis" course.
The following Algorithms and Datastructures have been implemented:
### Python and Cython
- Merge Sort and related algorithms
- Quicksort and related algorithms
- Contraction algorithm for minimum cut problem (Graphs)
- Dijkstra's algorithm (heap based)
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Computation of strongly connected components in directed Graphs
### Java
- Hash Table

### These are vanilla implementations only! The code was not optimized for performance!
