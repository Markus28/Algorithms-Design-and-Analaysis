# Lookup Data Structures
The following datastructures were implemented:
- Hash Table 
- Bloom Filter

Prime numbers are being used automatically for size. A prime number close to an arbitrary integer is found via Binary Search on a previously downloaded dataset. Lower and upper bounds for the index are provided by an inequality found in _Rosser, J. Barkley; Schoenfeld, Lowell (1962). "Approximate formulas for some functions of prime numbers". Illinois J. Math. 6: 64â€“94. ISSN 0019-2082._
